# JoystickTrainingSystems
This was the code written to control the robotic training device that I developed for a student with cerebral palsy. 

The Mobility Trainer Pro is a training system used by those who have cognitive disorders and are transitioning from a manual wheelchair assistant to a motorized one. The hypersensitivity of a motorized wheelchair, coupled with the cognitive disability of the patient causes multiple faults in the training phase, creating an unwanted and dysfunctional learning environment. The joystick in a motorized wheelchair is extremely sensitive and patients with cognitive and physical disabilities are not able to move it in the desired direction. They need extensive training on how to connect direction from the brain to their hand. 


The Mobility Trainer Pro is a simple accessory that can be placed on either the manual wheelchair or the motorized wheelchair. Essentially, this device provides pre mobility training to train and develop cognitive directional skills for the patient. Without the device, multiple tests prove that a patient will need extensive and costly training with Occupational Therapists on how to connect directional skills with the motorized wheelchair. However, the Mobility Trainer Pro is an accessory that can be taken home and used at any time and in any location. The device essentially has multiple features (which will be outlined in later sections) to develop the brainâ€™s directional skills in order to be utilized when moving the motorized wheelchair. A low cost, minimal assist, intuitive to use robotic device can help train people to use a motorized wheelchair and decrease the number of wheelchair related injuries. This robotic device can also be used by people with Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injuries who have similar limitations.
